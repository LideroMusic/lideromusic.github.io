				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was formed in <time datetime="1918">1918</time>; its name was changed to Yugoslavia in <time datetime="1929">1929</time>. Communist Partisans 
					resisted the Axis occupation and division of Yugoslavia from <time datetime="1941">1941</time> to <time datetime="1945">1945</time> and fought nationalist opponents and collaborators as well. 
					The military and political movement headed by Josip Broz "TITO" (Partisans) took full control of Yugoslavia when their domestic rivals and the 
					occupiers were defeated in <time datetime="1945">1945</time>. Although communists, TITO and his successors (Tito died in <time datetime="1980">1980</time>) managed to steer their own path between the Warsaw 
					Pact nations and the West for the next four and a half decades. In <time datetime="1989">1989</time>, Slobodan MILOSEVIC became president of the Republic of Serbia and his ultranationalist 
					calls for Serbian domination led to the violent breakup of Yugoslavia along ethnic lines. In <time datetime="1991">1991</time>, Croatia, Slovenia, and Macedonia declared independence, followed 
					by Bosnia in <time datetime="1992">1992</time>. The remaining republics of Serbia and Montenegro declared a new Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) in April <time datetime="1992">1992</time> and under MILOSEVIC's leadership, 
					Serbia led various military campaigns to unite ethnic Serbs in neighboring republics into a "Greater Serbia." These actions ultimately failed and, after international intervention, 
					led to the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords in <time datetime="1995">1995</time>.</p>
				
				<p>MILOSEVIC retained control over Serbia and eventually became president of the <abbr title="Federal Republic of Yugoslavia">FRY</abbr> in <time datetime="1997">1997</time>. In <time datetime="1998">1998</time>, an ethnic Albanian insurgency in the formerly autonomous Serbian province of Kosovo provoked a Serbian counterinsurgency 
					campaign that resulted in massacres and massive expulsions of ethnic Albanians living in Kosovo. The MILOSEVIC government's rejection of a proposed international settlement led to <abbr title="the North Atlantic Treaty Organization">NATO</abbr>'s bombing of Serbia in the spring 
					of <time datetime="1999">1999</time>. Serbian military and police forces withdrew from Kosovo in <time datetime="1999-06-01">June 1999</time>, and the <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> Security Council authorized an interim <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> administration and a <abbr title="the North Atlantic Treaty Organization">NATO</abbr>-led security force in Kosovo. <abbr title="Federal Republic of Yugoslavia">FRY</abbr> elections in late <time datetime="2000">2000</time> led 
					to the ouster of MILOSEVIC and the installation of democratic government. In <time datetime="2003">2003</time>, the FRY became the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, a loose federation of the two republics. Widespread violence predominantly targeting 
					ethnic Serbs in Kosovo in <time datetime="2004-03-01">March 2004</time> led to more intense calls to address Kosovo's status, and the <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> began facilitating status talks in <time datetime="2006">2006</time>. In <time datetime="2006-06-01">June 2006</time>, Montenegro seceded from the federation and declared itself an 
					independent nation. Serbia subsequently gave notice that it was the successor state to the union of Serbia and Montenegro.</p>

				<p>In February <time datetime="2008">2008</time>, after nearly two years of inconclusive negotiations, Kosovo declared itself independent of Serbia - an action Serbia refuses to recognize. At Serbia's request, the 
					<abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> General Assembly (<abbr title="United Nations General Assembly">UNGA</abbr>) in October <time datetime="2008">2008</time> sought an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (<abbr title="International Court of Justice">ICJ</abbr>) on whether Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence was in 
					accordance with international law. In a ruling considered unfavorable to Serbia, the <abbr title="International Court of Justice">ICJ</abbr> issued an advisory opinion in <time datetime="2010-07-01">July 2010</time> stating that international law did not prohibit declarations 
					of independence. In late <time datetime="2010">2010</time>, Serbia agreed to an EU-drafted <abbr title="United Nations General Assembly">UNGA</abbr> Resolution acknowledging the <abbr title="International Court of Justice">ICJ</abbr>'s decision and calling for a new round of talks between Serbia and Kosovo, this time on practical 
					issues rather than Kosovo's status. Serbia and Kosovo signed the first agreement of principles governing the normalization of relations between the two countries in April <time datetime="2013">2013</time> and are in the process 
					of implementing its provisions. In <time datetime="2015">2015</time>, Serbia and Kosovo reached four additional agreements within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-led Brussels Dialogue framework. These included agreements on the Community of Serb-Majority 
					Municipalities; telecommunications; energy production and distribution; and freedom of movement. President Aleksandar VUCIC has promoted an ambitious goal of Serbia joining the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> by <time datetime="2025">2025</time>. Under his leadership 
					as prime minister, in <time datetime="2014">2014</time> Serbia opened formal negotiations for accession.</p>
